### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
-  Data loading and inspection.
-  Handling missing values.
-  Data cleaning and formatting.
### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- Which product categories generate the most revenue?
- Which product categories generate the highest Order?
- How do sales and quantity sold vary across quarters?
- Which states or cities contribute most to total sales?
- Which customer provides the highest revenue?
### Results and Findings
The analysis results are summarised as follows:
-  The product category that generates the highest revenue is clothing.
-  Clothing is the product category with the highest number of orders.
-<pre> ### ðŸ“ˆ Sales and Quantity Sold Trends ``` Q1: Sales and quantity remained relatively stable throughout the first quarter. Q2: There was a sharp increase in both metrics toward the end of the second quarter. Q3: A decline occurred at the start of the third quarter, followed by a mid-quarter rise, and another dip toward the end. Q4: Sales and quantity levels stayed fairly consistent during the fourth quarter. ``` </pre>
-  The analysis indicates that targets were met by the end of the second quarter in 2024.
### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
-  More resources should be channelled towards the clothing category to increase revenue.
-  The company should consider increasing the budget for the second quarter to drive higher revenue.
### Limitations
I excluded all zero values from the budget and revenue columns to ensure the accuracy of the analysis, as they could have skewed the results.
